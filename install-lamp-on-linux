Step 1 — Installing Apache and Updating the Firewall

Then, install Apache with:

sudo apt install apache2

Once the installation is finished, you’ll need to adjust your firewall settings to allow HTTP traffic.
by opening the port to accept the requests

check Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) for extra info


sudo ufw app list

the following command will enable the port for apache:
sudo ufw allow Apache

Verify the change with:
sudo ufw status

Step 2 — Installing MySQL

mysql -u root -p


Step 3 — Installing PHP

you’ll need php-mysql, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases. You’ll also need libapache2-mod-php to enable Apache to handle PHP files. Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies.
also php for sure


sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

Once the installation is finished, run the following command to confirm your PHP version:
php -v

Step 4 — Creating a Virtual Host for your Website















{
edit only on sites-avaliable 

write in ports.conf then enable it by sudo ufw allow port-number




you have to enable the virtual host by sudo a2ensite your_domain

this will close the virtual host
sudo a2dissite your_domain

To make sure your configuration file doesn’t contain syntax errors, run the following command:
sudo apache2ctl configtest

reload Apache to save the changes:
sudo systemctl reload apache2
}
